On Docker Quickstart Terminal
Checked I have python installed
$ python -V
2.7.6

Downloaded the 64-bit sdk, google-cloud-sdk-182.0.0-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz

Unzipped it. Moved it to /Users/jonjagger

$ source /Users/jonjagger/Applications/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc

SSH'd in
$ gcloud compute --project "cyber-dojo" ssh --zone "europe-west1-b" "ssd-server"
$ pwd
/home/jonjagger

So, I created backup256th.sh file there and ran it.
$ sudo ./backup 42

Now to to scp it off.

$ gcloud compute --project "cyber-dojo" \
  scp --zone "europe-west1-b" \
  jonjagger@ssd-server:/home/jonjagger/katas_42.tgz .

And it is copying... Done.
Checked I can untar it. Yes.
See get256th.sh for script of ssh and scp together.
