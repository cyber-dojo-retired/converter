conversion of old-format katas to new-format katas...
-----------------------------------------------------

The converter will
o) upgrade from old format manifest to new-format
   Conversion needs to be based on the image-name.
   Conversion would also incorporate the display-name renames.
   There will also be katas for test-frameworks that
   are no longer live. Eg the acceptance-based ones.
   And some that were put offline because they were too slow.
o) upgrade old style katas (that used the .git format) to the
   new non-git format, one dir per traffic-light.

This will simplify the web model quite a lot.

This could be called from inside the storer (on a per kata basis).
Whenever the storer does anything, it first informs
the converter to convert the kata with the given id.

Or it could be run as a one-time conversion. If in the later mode,
will need to mount a katas docker data-volume.


Strategy for doing this...
--------------------------
Do this in chunks. Naturally have 256 top level
dirs (00/ --> FF/). Do one chunk first.
Got that from the main live server in local katas_42.tgz file.

If an old-kata format is detected I should first create
a test for this and capture the kata-id in a read-only
kata volume. Similar to what I do for the storer testing
where I have to create a volume with a kata in the old git
format inside it. Remember I do this by storing the tgz
file in the git repo and tar-unpiping it into a container.

How to "unroll" this to the main katas volume?
How about leaving
katas/01/2345678/ in place and creating its new version in
new/01/2345678/
And, if this works, then
o) moving 01/2345678 to old/01/2345678
o) moving new/01/2345678 to katas/01/2345678
